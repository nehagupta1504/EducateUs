          Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
          system, which fall under the command of the government at three
          levels: federal, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian
          Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
          Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
          fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. .

          From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
          responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a
          country as large as India, now with 28 states and eight union
          territories, this means that the potential for variations between
          states in the policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary
          education is vast. Periodically, national policy frameworks are
          created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and
          policies. State governments and local government bodies manage the
          majority of primary and upper primary schools and the number of
          government-managed elementary schools is growing.

          At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school
          system complementing the government run schools, with 29% of students
          receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.[17] Certain
          post-secondary technical schools are also private. The private
          education market in India had a revenue of US$450 million in 2008, but
          is projected to be a US$40 billion market.[18]
